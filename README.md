# StrongBox

The sole purpose of this project is to review different notions of the Android framework for personal study only.

There is no particular effort about the object oriented programming.
Good practice in naming and style rules are put aside.
Only for a moment.

The project is a classic application that can hold different passwords.

The planned features would be:
- Backup of the identifiers
- Selection of several accounts (onedrive, google drive, dropbox, ...) to backup the identifiers on different cloud storage
- Synchronization of the backup through a service with notification
- Encryption/decryption of the backup
- Encryption/decryption of the entries of the database
- Cloud Printing
- Use of asymetric key to share an entry

The different notions of the Android framework that are expected to be reviewed:
- RecyclerView
- SQL lite database
- CursorLoader
- ContentResolver
- ContentObserver
- Background threads in general
- IntentService
- Notification
- Serialization with Gson
- Google Cloud Platform
- Fragment
- Eventually, material design
